# Amazon_Vine_Analysis
**Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to create a data base using Amazon's AWS program. Once we created a database, we had to upload data we created using google Pyspark. Once we created the data, we uploaded it into our Amazon data base using SQL to create tables that we can access. Finally we took the data and preformed an analysis on it to find specific data from the vine table that we created.
**Results
How many vines reviews and non-Vine rewiews were there?
	From the data that we created, we found that the number of vine reviews were 102, and the number of non-vine reviews were 64008. 
How many vine reviews were 5 stars? How many non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
	From the data, we fond that 48 vine reviews were 5 stars, and only 20282 reviews were 5 stars 
What percentage of Vine reviews were 5 stars? What percentage of non-Vine reviews were 5 stars?
	The total percentage of vine rewiews compared to the rest of the reviews that were 5 stars were 47%, compared to the number of non-vine reviews that were only 31.6%.
**Summary
	In the analyis for this project, we had to create a database using an Amazon AWS. We thing pulled a data from a list of reviews from a certain type of product. Finally , we found the amount of Vine and non-Vine reviews that were 5 stars compared to all of the products. From what we can see in terms of total reviews, we can conclude that there seems to be some sort of relationship between products being paid for a review and receiving a five-star review. From what we can tell, there seems to be a much higher chance for a product to recieve a 5 star review if they were paid. One additional analysis that could be preformed in order to see the effectiveness of paid reviews is to look at the total percentage of one star reveiws. If the conclusion remained true then the amount of one star paid reviews would be much less than the unpaid reviews.
